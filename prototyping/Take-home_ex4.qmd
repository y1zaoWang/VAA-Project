# **1  Overview**

For this Take Home Exercise, there are several task needs to be done to create the Shiny application.

-   To evaluate and determine the necessary R packages needed for your Shiny application are supported in R CRAN,

-   To prepare and test the specific R codes can be run and returned the correct output as expected,

-   To determine the parameters and outputs that will be exposed on the Shiny applications, and

-   To select the appropriate Shiny UI components for exposing the parameters determine above.

This submission includes the prototype report for the group project, which will includes:

-   the data preparation process,

-   the selection of data visualization techniques used,

-   and the data visualization design and interactivity principles and best practices implemented.

Based on the discussion with team member i will be focusing on the Exploratory Data Analysis & Confirmatory Data Analysis, and the UI design for our Shiny app.

# **2  Project Information**

The purpose of this project is to create a Shiny app with user-friendly interface and functions, and also create a website for user to discover the historical Weather changes in Singapore.

# **3  Get Started (Load R Packages)**

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse,ggridges,ggrepel,ggthemes,ggstatsplot,ggsignif,
               hrbrthemes,patchwork,dplyr, gifski, gapminder,plotly,
               gganimate,ggiraph,magick,highcharter,knitr,naniar,DT,imputeTS,ggHoriPlot,stars,terra,gstat,RColorBrewer)
```

# 4 . Data Preparation

import the merged data of all the stations across 10 years (2014-2023)

```{r}
rfdata <- read.csv('data/merged_data.csv')
```

Import the data that includes the latitude and longitude of the weather stations in Singapore.

```{r}
rfstation <- read.csv('data/RainfallStation.csv')

rfstation <- rfstation %>%
  rename(Station = Station.Code)
```

Join the latitude and longitude to the rfdata, so that in the analysis part we can map the geospatial analysis.

```{r}
raw_weather_data <- rfdata  %>%
  left_join(rfstation, by = "Station")
```

This dataset was retrieved from the [Meteorological Service Singapore](http://www.weather.gov.sg/climate-historical-daily/) site, and had some basic [pre-processing steps performed in python](https://isss608-airweatheranalytics.netlify.app/code/data_retrieval) due to the large amount of files:

-   Combine all downloaded CSV files into one dataframe.

-   Add the latitude and longitude of each station to the data frame.

## 4.1 Check structure with `glimpse()`

```{r}
glimpse(raw_weather_data)
```

There are 204464 rows, and 15 columns in the dataset. We see that there are missing values shown as '?' in the dataset. In the next few steps, we will drop specific columns and rows based on the project focus.

## 4.2 Drop unused columns

We will not be using all 15 columns for this project. The following columns will be dropped:

-   `Highest 30 Min Rainfall (mm)`

-   `Highest 60 Min Rainfall (mm)`

-   `Highest 1200 Min Rainfall (mm)`

-   `Mean Wind Speed (km/h)`

-   `Max Wind Speed (km/h)`

```{r}
raw_weather_data <- raw_weather_data %>%
  select(-c(`Highest.30.min.Rainfall..mm.`, 
            `Highest.60.min.Rainfall..mm.`, 
            `Highest.120.min.Rainfall..mm.`,
            `Mean.Wind.Speed..km.h.`,
            `Max.Wind.Speed..km.h.`))
```

## 4.3 Remove rows for specific Stations

The Meteorological Service Singapore also provides a file, [Station Records](http://www.weather.gov.sg/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Station_Records.pdf) that has some information on the availability of data for each station. After examining the station records file, we found that 41 stations had missing information for some variables. We will hence drop rows for these stations.

```{r}
# Drop rows of 41 stations
# Define the station names to remove
stations_to_remove <- c("Macritchie Reservoir", "Lower Peirce Reservoir", "Pasir Ris (West)", "Kampong Bahru", "Jurong Pier", "Ulu Pandan", "Serangoon", "Jurong (East)", "Mandai", "Upper Thomson", "Buangkok", "Boon Lay (West)", "Bukit Panjang", "Kranji Reservoir", "Tanjong Pagar", "Admiralty West", "Queenstown", "Tanjong Katong", "Chai Chee", "Upper Peirce Reservoir", "Kent Ridge", "Somerset (Road)", "Punggol", "Tuas West", "Simei", "Toa Payoh", "Tuas", "Bukit Timah", "Yishun", "Buona Vista", "Pasir Ris (Central)", "Jurong (North)", "Choa Chu Kang (West)", "Serangoon North", "Lim Chu Kang", "Marine Parade", "Choa Chu Kang (Central)", "Dhoby Ghaut", "Nicoll Highway", "Botanic Garden", "Whampoa")

# Remove rows with the specified station names
raw_weather_data <- raw_weather_data[!raw_weather_data$Station %in% stations_to_remove, ]

# Print the number of stations left
print(sprintf(" %d stations removed. %d stations left.", length(stations_to_remove), n_distinct(raw_weather_data$Station)))
```

## 4.4 Check for duplicates

```{r}
# Identify duplicates
duplicates <- raw_weather_data[duplicated(raw_weather_data[c("Station", "Year", "Month", "Day")]) | duplicated(raw_weather_data[c("Station", "Year", "Month", "Day")], fromLast = TRUE), ]

# Check if 'duplicates' dataframe is empty
if (nrow(duplicates) == 0) {
  print("The combination of Station Name, Year, Month, and Day is unique.")
} else {
  print("There are duplicates in the combination of Station Name, Year, Month, and Day. Showing duplicated rows:")
  print(duplicates)
}
```

## 4.5 Check and handle missing values

### 4.5.1 First check for missing values

Missing values in this dataset can be represented by:

-   `\u0097`

-   `NA`

-   `-`

We first replace these values with actual NA values:

```{r}
raw_weather_data <- raw_weather_data %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.character), ~na_if(.x, "\u0097"))) %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.character), ~na_if(.x, "NA"))) %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.character), ~na_if(.x, "-")))
```

Next, we visualize the missing values in the dataset:

```{r}
# For a simple missing data plot
gg_miss_var(raw_weather_data)
```

We can see there is quite a number of missing data in the Mean Temperature, Minimum Temperature, Maximum Temperature and Daily Rainfall Total. We will take steps to handle the missing data.

### 4.5.2 Remove Stations with significant missing data

We have identified two checks to make:

-   Check which stations have no recorded data for entire months.

-   Check which stations have more than 7 consecutive days of missing data

For both these checks, we will remove the entire station from the dataset as it would not be practical to impute such large amounts of missing values.

#### **4.5.3 Identify and remove Stations with no recorded data for entire months**

Some stations have no recorded data for entire months, as summarised in the table below:

```{r}
# Create complete combination of Station, Year, and Month
all_combinations <- expand.grid(
  Station = unique(raw_weather_data$Station),
  Year = 2021:2023,
  Month = 1:12
)

# Left join this with the original weather data to identify missing entries
missing_months <- all_combinations %>%
  left_join(raw_weather_data, by = c("Station", "Year", "Month")) %>%
  # Use is.na() to check for rows that didn't have a match in the original data
  filter(is.na(Day)) %>%
  # Select only the relevant columns for the final output
  select(Station, Year, Month)

# Create a summary table that lists out the missing months
missing_months_summary <- missing_months %>%
  group_by(Station, Year) %>%
  summarise(MissingMonths = toString(sort(unique(Month))), .groups = 'drop')

kable(missing_months_summary)
```

We hence drop these stations from our dataset:

```{r}
raw_weather_data <- anti_join(raw_weather_data, missing_months, by = "Station")

print(sprintf("The folowing %d stations were dropped: %s", n_distinct(missing_months$Station), paste(unique(missing_months$Station), collapse = ", ")))
```

```{r}
print(sprintf("There are %d stations left: ", n_distinct(raw_weather_data$Station)))
```

```{r}
kable(unique(raw_weather_data$Station),
      row.names = TRUE,
      col.names = "Station",
      caption = "List of Remaining Stations")
```

#### **4.5.4 Identify and remove Stations with excessive missing values**

If there are any missing values, we can try to impute these missing values. However, if there are 7 or more consecutive values missing, we will remove these stations first.

```{r}
# Define a helper function to count the number of 7 or more consecutive NAs
count_seven_consecutive_NAs <- function(x) {
  na_runs <- rle(is.na(x))
  total_consecutive_NAs <- sum(na_runs$lengths[na_runs$values & na_runs$lengths >= 7])
  return(total_consecutive_NAs)
}

# Apply the helper function to each relevant column within grouped data
weather_summary <- raw_weather_data %>%
  group_by(Station, Year, Month) %>%
  summarise(across(-Day, ~ count_seven_consecutive_NAs(.x), .names = "count_consec_NAs_{.col}"), .groups = "drop")

# Filter to keep only rows where there is at least one column with 7 or more consecutive missing values
weather_summary_with_consecutive_NAs <- weather_summary %>%
  filter(if_any(starts_with("count_consec_NAs_"), ~ . > 0))

# View the result
print(sprintf("There are %d stations with 7 or more consecutive missing values.", n_distinct(weather_summary_with_consecutive_NAs$Station)))
```

```{r}
# kable(weather_summary_with_consecutive_NAs)
datatable(weather_summary_with_consecutive_NAs, 
            class= "compact",
            rownames = FALSE,
            width="100%", 
            options = list(pageLength = 10, scrollX=T),
          caption = 'Details of stations with >=7 missing values')
```

We hence drop these stations from our dataset:

```{r}
raw_weather_data <- anti_join(raw_weather_data, weather_summary_with_consecutive_NAs, by = "Station")

print(sprintf("The folowing %d stations were dropped: %s", n_distinct(weather_summary_with_consecutive_NAs$Station), paste(unique(weather_summary_with_consecutive_NAs$Station), collapse = ", ")))
```

```{r}
print(sprintf("There are %d stations left: ", n_distinct(raw_weather_data$Station)))
```

```{r}
kable(unique(raw_weather_data$Station),
      row.names = TRUE,
      col.names = "Station",
      caption = "List of Remaining Stations")
```

### 4.5.5 Second check for missing values

From the check below we see there are still missing values in our data. We will impute these values in the next step.

```{r}
# For a simple missing data plot
gg_miss_var(raw_weather_data)
```

We can see that there is still a few missing values from the selected stations.

### 4.6 Impute missing values

To handle the missing values for the remaining Stations, we will impute missing values using simple moving average from **imputeTS** package.

```{r}
raw_weather_data <- raw_weather_data %>%
  mutate(Date = as.Date(paste(Year, Month, Day, sep = "-"))) %>%
  relocate(Date, .after = 1)
```

```{r}
# Define the weather variables to loop through
weather_variables <- c("Daily.Rainfall.Total..mm.", "Mean.Temperature...C.", "Maximum.Temperature...C.", "Minimum.Temperature...C.")

# Ensure raw_weather_data is correctly copied to a new data frame for imputation
weather_data_imputed <- raw_weather_data

# Loop through each weather variable to impute missing values
for(variable in weather_variables) {
  # Convert variable to numeric, ensuring that the conversion warnings are handled if necessary
  weather_data_imputed[[variable]] <- as.numeric(as.character(weather_data_imputed[[variable]]))
  
  # Impute missing values using a moving average
  weather_data_imputed <- weather_data_imputed %>%
    group_by(Station) %>%
    arrange(Station, Date) %>%
    mutate("{variable}" := round(na_ma(.data[[variable]], k = 7, weighting = "simple"), 1)) %>%
    ungroup()
}
```

### 4.7 Add specific columns to data \[NEW\]

These columns are added as they may be used in plots later.

```{r}
weather_data_imputed <- weather_data_imputed %>% 
  mutate(Date_mine = make_date(2023, month(Date), day(Date)),
         Month_Name = factor(months(Date), levels = month.name),
         Week = isoweek(Date),
         Weekday = wday(Date)
  )
```

## 4.8 Summary of cleaned data

### Details of stations and time period of data

```{r}
time_period_start <- min(weather_data_imputed$Date)
time_period_end <- max(weather_data_imputed$Date)
cat("\nThe time period of the dataset is from", format(time_period_start, "%Y-%m-%d"),"to", format(time_period_end, "%Y-%m-%d"), "\n")

```

but i only want to keep until 2023, exclude record in 2024

```{r}
weather_data_imputed <- subset(weather_data_imputed, Date <= as.Date("2023-12-31"))

time_period_start <- min(weather_data_imputed$Date)
time_period_end <- max(weather_data_imputed$Date)
cat("\nThe time period of the dataset is from", format(time_period_start, "%Y-%m-%d"),"to", format(time_period_end, "%Y-%m-%d"), "\n")
```

And also to ease further analysis, convert year, month, day to factor data type:

```{r}
weather_data_imputed <- weather_data_imputed %>%
  mutate_at(vars(Year,Month,Day),as.factor)

glimpse(weather_data_imputed)
```

```{r}
kable(unique(weather_data_imputed$Station),
      row.names = TRUE,
      col.names = "Station",
      caption = "List of Stations")
```

### View dataset as interactive table

```{r}
datatable(weather_data_imputed, 
            class= "compact",
            rownames = FALSE,
            width="100%", 
            options = list(pageLength = 10, scrollX=T),
          caption = 'Cleaned and imputed weather dataset')
```

```{r}
colnames(weather_data_imputed)[6] <- "Daily_Rainfall_Total_mm"
colnames(weather_data_imputed)[7] <- "Mean_Temperature"
colnames(weather_data_imputed)[8] <- "Max_Temperature"
colnames(weather_data_imputed)[9] <- "Min_Temperature"
```

# **5  EDA & CDA**

```{r}
ggstatsplot::ggcorrmat(data = weather_data_imputed, type = "continuous")
```

For the explorartory analysis we can use boxplot to see the

```{r}

data_2023 <- filter(weather_data_imputed, Year == 2023)

# Create the ggplot object
p1 <- ggplot(data = data_2023 %>% filter(Station == "Changi"),
             aes(y = Mean_Temperature, x = Month_Name)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust=1)) +
  labs(title = "Mean Temperature by Month for Changi Station, 2023",
       y = "Mean Temperature (°C)", x = "Month")

# Convert to an interactive plotly object
p1_interactive <- ggplotly(p1, tooltip = c("y", "x"))

# Display the interactive plot
p1_interactive

```

```{r}

ggplot(data=weather_data_imputed, aes(x=Date,y=Mean_Temperature)) +
  geom_line() + xlab("Year") + ylab("Daily Mean Temperature")
```

From the time series analysis on top, we clearly see that there is seasonal trend in different months in Singapore.

```{r}
weather_data_filtered <- weather_data_imputed %>%
  filter(Station == "Changi")  # Filter the data for JFK airport

# Plotting using ggplot2
p <- ggplot(data = weather_data_filtered, aes(x = Date, y = Mean_Temperature, text = paste("Date: ", Date, "<br>Mean Temperature: ", Mean_Temperature))) +
  geom_point() +  # Scatter plot
  xlab("Date") + ylab("Daily Mean Temperature") +
  ggtitle("Mean Temperature at Changi Weather Station")  # Add title

# Convert ggplot to plotly
ggplotly(p)
```

Horizon Plot:

To have a more clear view of the distribution across the months, we can use a horizon plot to see the distribution and cut points.

```{r}
# Ensure data has Year, Month, Date column + Date_mine column
weather_data <- weather_data_imputed %>% 
  mutate(Year = year(Date)) %>%
  mutate(Month = month(Date)) %>%
  mutate(Day = day(Date)) %>%
  mutate(Date_mine = make_date(2023, month(Date), day(Date)))


# compute origin and  horizon scale cutpoints: 
cutoffs <- weather_data %>% 
  mutate(
    outlier = between(
      `Mean_Temperature`, 
      quantile(`Mean_Temperature`, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE) -
        1.5 * IQR(`Mean_Temperature`, na.rm = TRUE),
      quantile(`Mean_Temperature`, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE) +
        1.5 * IQR(`Mean_Temperature`, na.rm = TRUE))) %>% 
  filter(outlier)

ori <- sum(range(cutoffs$`Mean_Temperature`))/2
sca <- seq(range(cutoffs$`Mean_Temperature`)[1], 
           range(cutoffs$`Mean_Temperature`)[2], 
           length.out = 7)[-4]

ori <- round(ori, 2) # The origin, rounded to 2 decimal places
sca <- round(sca, 2) # The horizon scale cutpoints

# Plot horizon plot
weather_data %>% ggplot() +
  geom_horizon(aes(x = Date_mine, 
                   y = `Mean_Temperature`,
                   fill = after_stat(Cutpoints)), 
               origin = ori, horizonscale = sca) +
  scale_fill_hcl(palette = 'RdBu', reverse = T) +
  facet_grid(~Station ~ .) +
  theme_few() +
  theme(
    panel.spacing.y = unit(0, "lines"),
    strip.text.y = element_text(size = 7, angle = 0, hjust = 0),
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    axis.title.y = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
    panel.border = element_blank()
    ) +
  scale_x_date(expand = c(0, 0), 
               date_breaks = "1 month", 
               date_labels = "%b") +
  xlab('Date') +
  ggtitle('Mean Temperature across Month',
          'By different stations')
```

From the Analysis, we can see that clearly there are months with much lower temperature compare to other months. For example, Jan, Feb, Mar we can observe that they mostly have maximum temperature of 28 degrees celcirse

After the data preparation, for exploratory data analysis will be introducing the horizon plot, and tmap to explore the data set will visual.

Boxplot:

```{r}
box_plot_t1 <- ggplot(weather_data_imputed, 
                   aes(y= Mean_Temperature,
                       x = Year)) +
  geom_boxplot()+
  facet_wrap(~Station) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60)) +
  scale_x_discrete(name = "Year") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Mean Temperature")

box_plot_t1
```

## 5.2 CDA Hypothesis

This confirmatory data analysis section will check the data based on the certain hypothesis made from the exploratory & descriptive analysis in the above sections.

As of now, two hypothesis are made:

-   Does Singapore's weather change across different years shows statistical significant?

-   can we clearly identify the 'dry' and 'wet' month?

### 5.2.1Does Singapore's Weather Change Across Different Years Shows Statistical Significant?

In this part, the weather change accounts for both the temperature and the rainfall as given in the data used.

#### 5.2.1.1 Temperature

```{r}
temp_year1 <- weather_data_imputed %>%
  group_by(Station,Year) %>%
  summarise(median_mean_temp = median(Mean_Temperature),
            median_max_temp = median(Max_Temperature),
            median_min_temp = median(Min_Temperature))

DT::datatable(temp_year1,class = "compact")
```

```{r}
glimpse(temp_year1)
```

Save the output as csv:

```{r}
write_csv(temp_year1, "data/temp_year1.csv")
```

To check out the median mean, max and min temperature:

::: panel-tabset
## Median Daily Mean Temperature

```{r}
plot_list <- lapply(unique(temp_year1$Station), function(stn) {
  station_data <- subset(temp_year1, Station == stn)
  
  plot_ly(data = station_data, x = ~Year, y = ~median_mean_temp, name = stn, type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines',
          hoverinfo = 'text', text = ~paste("Station:", stn, "<br>Year:", Year, "<br>Temp:", median_mean_temp)) %>%
    layout(title = paste("Median Mean Temperature - Station:", stn),
           xaxis = list(title = "Year"),
           yaxis = list(title = "Temperature (°C)"))
})

p2 <- subplot(plot_list, nrows = length(unique(temp_year1$Station)), shareX = TRUE, titleX = FALSE)

p2 <- layout(p2,
                       title = "Median Daily Mean Temperature Across Weather Stations (2014-2023)",
                       xaxis = list(tickangle = 90),
                       margin = list(b = 80)) # Increase bottom margin to accommodate angled x-axis labels
p2
```

Based on the line graph, we can not say that there the mean temperature across selected weather stations have significant changes from year 2014 to 2023.

## Median Daily MAX Temperature

```{r}
plot_list <- lapply(unique(temp_year1$Station), function(stn) {
  station_data <- subset(temp_year1, Station == stn)
  
  plot_ly(data = station_data, x = ~Year, y = ~median_max_temp, name = stn, type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines',
          hoverinfo = 'text', text = ~paste("Station:", stn, "<br>Year:", Year, "<br>Temp:", median_max_temp)) %>%
    layout(title = paste("Median Max Temperature - Station:", stn),
           xaxis = list(title = "Year"),
           yaxis = list(title = "Temperature (°C)"))
})

p3 <- subplot(plot_list, nrows = length(unique(temp_year1$Station)), shareX = TRUE, titleX = FALSE)

p3 <- layout(p3,
                       title = "Median Daily Maximum Temperature Across Weather Stations (2014-2023)",
                       xaxis = list(tickangle = 90),
                       margin = list(b = 80)) # Increase bottom margin to accommodate angled x-axis labels
p3
```

## Median Daily MIN Temperature

```{r}
p4 <- lapply(unique(temp_year1$Station), function(stn) {
  station_data <- subset(temp_year1, Station == stn)
  
  plot_ly(data = station_data, x = ~Year, y = ~median_min_temp, name = stn, type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines',
          hoverinfo = 'text', text = ~paste("Station:", stn, "<br>Year:", Year, "<br>Temp:", median_min_temp)) %>%
    layout(title = paste("Median Min Temperature - Station:", stn),
           xaxis = list(title = "Year"),
           yaxis = list(title = "Temperature (°C)"))
})

p4 <- subplot(p4, nrows = length(unique(temp_year1$Station)), shareX = TRUE, titleX = FALSE)

p4 <- layout(p4,
                       title = "Median Daily Minimum Temperature Across Weather Stations (2014-2023)",
                       xaxis = list(tickangle = 90),
                       margin = list(b = 80)) # Increase bottom margin to accommodate angled x-axis labels
p4
```
:::

Before performing statistical test on the significant level, is best to determine how the temperature data is distributed in the data. We can observe the normality of the data using ridgeline plots, using the code chunk below:

::: panel-tabset
## Normality Daily Mean Temperature

```{r}
p5 <- ggplot(weather_data_imputed, 
       aes(x = Mean_Temperature, 
           y = as.factor(Year), 
           fill = 0.5 - abs(0.5 - ..ecdf..))) +
  stat_density_ridges(geom = "density_ridges_gradient", 
                      calc_ecdf = TRUE) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = "Tail probability",
                       direction = -1,
                       option="turbo") +
  facet_wrap(~Station, scales = "free_y") + 
  theme_ridges(font_size = 12) + # Adjusted for smaller text
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,50)) +
  labs(title="Distribution of Mean Temperature from 2014 to 2023",
       y="Station",
       x="Mean Temperature (°C)")

p5

```

Based on the above observation, as the mean temperature is not normally distributed, non-parametric test will be used.

## Normality Daily Max Temperature

Based on the above observation, as the maximum temperature is not normally distributed, non-parametric test will be used.

## Median Mean temperature Per Year

**The hypothesis is as follows:**

*H~0~: There is no statistical difference between yearly median mean temperature from 2014-2023.*

*H~1~: There is statistical difference between yearly median mean temperature from 2014-2023.*

Kruskal-Wallis Test: The test has a x\^2 value of 19.82 and a p-value of 0.02, which is below the conventional alpha level of 0.05. This suggests that there is statistically significant difference in median maximum temperatures across the years.

## Median Max temperature Per Year

**The** **hypothesis is as follows:**

But from yearly difference we can further dig into the daily difference to see if there is a statistical difference.

## Median Min temperature Per Year

**The** **hypothesis is as follows:**

**Kruskal-Wallis Test**: The test has a x\^2 value of 14.72 and a p-value of 0.10, which is above the conventional alpha level of 0.05. This suggests that there is no statistically significant difference in median maximum temperatures across the years. But from yearly difference we can further dig into the daily difference to see if there is a statistical difference.

## Important

All daily temperatures (mean, maximum and minimum) have p-value lower than 0.05 which means they all shows statistical significant. Meaning there are statistical different in the mean, maximum and minimum daily temperature in Singapore.

-   Even though the yearly median max temperature and median min temperature appears no statistical significant, but the daily max and min are statistically different.

#### 5.2.1.2 Rainfall

For rainfall we will be using the daily rainfall total to test the hypothesis

```{r}
rainfall_year <- weather_data_imputed %>%
  group_by(Station,Year) %>%
  summarise(yearly_rainfall = sum(Daily_Rainfall_Total_mm))

DT::datatable(rainfall_year,class = "compact")
```

```{r}
write_csv(rainfall_year, "data/rainfall_year.csv")
```

```{r}
plot_list <- lapply(unique(rainfall_year$Station), function(stn) {
  station_data <- subset(rainfall_year, Station == stn)
  
  plot_ly(data = station_data, x = ~Year, y = ~yearly_rainfall, name = stn, type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines') %>%
    layout(title = paste("Yearly Rainfall - Station:", stn),
           xaxis = list(title = "Year", tickangle = 90),
           yaxis = list(title = "Rainfall Volume (mm)"))
})

faceted_plot <- subplot(plot_list, nrows = length(unique(rainfall_year$Station)), shareX = TRUE, titleX = FALSE)

faceted_plot <- layout(faceted_plot,
                       title = "Yearly Rainfall Across Weather Stations (2014-2023)")
faceted_plot

```

From the observations above, over the pass 10 years from 2014 to 2023 the total rainfall for Singapore captured by different stations indicates there is a volume increase. And every a few years it tend to drop to a low point(2015 and 2019) and will bounce back with even higher volume.

We have to check if the different in years of the total rainfall are statistically different, before making any conclusions. But first lets see if the data follows a normal distribution or not in determine the method for test later.

```{r}
p7 <- ggplot(weather_data_imputed, 
       aes(x = Daily_Rainfall_Total_mm, 
           y = as.factor(Year), 
           fill = 0.5 - abs(0.5 - ..ecdf..))) +
  stat_density_ridges(geom = "density_ridges_gradient", 
                      calc_ecdf = TRUE) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = "Tail probability",
                       direction = -1,
                       option="turbo")+
  facet_wrap(~Station) + 
  theme_ridges(font_size = 12)+

  labs(title="Distribution of Daily Rainfall from 2014 to 2023",
       y="Station",
       x="Rainfall Volume (mm)")

p7
```

From the distribution graph using sstat function called `stat_density_ridges()`of ggplot2. We can see that the rainfall distribution is not normally distributed, so non-parametric test will be used.

Kruskal-Wallis test result at the top indicates a significant difference in rainfall distribution across the years (p-value \< 0.01), suggesting that at least one year has a statistically different total rainfall volume compared to the others.

from the lines connecting the years we can observe that some years trend towards significance when the pHolm-adj is less than 1.00. Hence we can **reject the null hypothesis** and say that the rainfall over the years is **statistically significant**.

## Median Daily Rainfall 2014-2023

**Hypothesis:**

*H~0~: There is no statistical difference between median daily rainfall from 2014-2023.*

*H~1~: There is statistical difference between median daily rainfall from 2014-2023.*

```{r}
p9 <- ggbetweenstats(
  data = weather_data_imputed,
  x = Year, 
  y = Daily_Rainfall_Total_mm,
  type = "np",
  pairwise.display = "non-significant",
  messages = FALSE,
  title="Distribution of Rainfall from 2014 to 2023",
  ylab = "Rainfall volume (mm)",
  xlab = "Year",
  ggsignif.args = list(textsize = 4)
) +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 12), plot.title=element_text(size=12))

p9
```

We can dig further into the daily rainfall total to see if there is statistical significant. After undergo the test above, we can observe the test result that overall Kruskal-Wallis test is highly significant (p=2.84e−89), indicating there are differences in the distributions of daily rainfall volumes across the years.

We can also observe that some years the median daily rainfall is 0.00 or 0.20 (2014, 2015, 2019, etc.) suggesting low rainfall volume.

### 5.2.2 Can We Clearly Identify the 'Dry' and 'Wet' Month?

Singapore which is a tropical country, means have no clear identification of the four seasons, but there are certain months which the 'cooler' compare to some months. In this section we will be testing the hypothesis on 'can we clearly identify the 'Dry' and 'Wet' Month'?

First we need to filter the data to get monthly records, code chunk below:

```{r}
rf_data_month <- weather_data_imputed %>%
  group_by(Year,Month) %>%
  summarise(monthly_rainfall = sum(Daily_Rainfall_Total_mm))

rf_data_month$Year <- factor(rf_data_month$Year)
rf_data_month$Month <- factor(rf_data_month$Month, levels = as.character(1:12))

DT::datatable(rf_data_month,class = "compact")
```

```{r}
glimpse(rf_data_month)
```

```{r}
temp_month <- weather_data_imputed %>%
  group_by(Year,Month) %>%
  summarise(median_mean_temp = median(Mean_Temperature),
            median_max_temp = median(Max_Temperature),
            median_min_temp = median(Min_Temperature))

DT::datatable(temp_month,class = "compact")
```

To see the distribution of the monthly rainfall and Temperature, code chunk below:

::: panel-tabset
## Distribution of Monthly Rainfall

```{r}
color_palette <- brewer.pal("Set3", n = length(unique(rf_data_month$Year)))

p18 <- ggplot(rf_data_month, aes(x = Month, y = monthly_rainfall, fill = Year)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  facet_wrap(~Year, scales = "free_x") +
  labs(title = "Monthly Rainfall From Year 2014 to 2023",
       y = "Rainfall volume (mm)",
       x = "Month") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = color_palette) +
  theme(panel.spacing.y = unit(0.5, "lines")) # Adjusted for less spacing

p18
```

From the distribution of monthly rainfall from year 2014 to 2023, we can observe that the data is not normally distributed, hence non-parametric test will be used later.

## Distribution of Monthly Mean Temperature

```{r}
p19 <- ggplot(temp_month,
       aes(y = median_mean_temp,
           x = Month,
           colour = Year)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.5)+
  facet_wrap(~Year, scales = "free_x") +
  labs(title="Monthly mean Temperature From 2014 to 2023",
       y = "Temperature (°C)",
       x = "Month")+
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(20,35))+
  scale_x_discrete(limits = 1:12) + # Assuming Month is numeric already
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.spacing.y = unit(0.5,"lines"))

p19
```

From the distribution of monthly mean temperature from year 2014 to 2023, we can observe that the data is not normally distributed, hence non-parametric test will be used later.

## Distribution of Monthly Max Temperature

```{r}
p20 <- ggplot(temp_month,
       aes(y = median_max_temp,
           x = Month,
           colour = Year)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.5)+
  facet_wrap(~Year, scales = "free_x") +
  labs(title="Monthly Maximum Temperature From 2014 to 2023",
       y = "Temperature (°C)",
       x = "Month")+
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(20,35))+
  scale_x_discrete(limits = 1:12) + # Assuming Month is numeric already
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.spacing.y = unit(0.5,"lines"))

p20
```

From the distribution of monthly maximum temperature from year 2014 to 2023, we can observe that the data is not normally distributed, hence non-parametric test will be used later.

## Distribution of Monthly Min Temperature

```{r}
p21 <- ggplot(temp_month,
       aes(y = median_min_temp,
           x = Month,
           colour = Year)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.5)+
  facet_wrap(~Year, scales = "free_x") +
  labs(title="Monthly Minimum Temperature From 2014 to 2023",
       y = "Temperature (°C)",
       x = "Month")+
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(20,35))+
  scale_x_discrete(limits = 1:12) + # Assuming Month is numeric already
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.spacing.y = unit(0.5,"lines"))

p21
```

From the distribution of monthly minimum temperature from year 2014 to 2023, we can observe that the data is not normally distributed, hence non-parametric test will be used later.

From the hypothesis testing, result indicates that we can clearly identify the 'Dry' or 'Wet' months, and also the 'Hot' and 'Cool' months from the date used.

From the hypothesis testing, several result can be shown:

-   Dry Month: 2, 3, 7, 8, 9

-   Wet Month :1, 6, 11, 12

-   Hot Month: 3, 4, 5, 9, 10

-   Cool Month: 1, 2, 11, 12

-   Dry & Hot : 3, 9

-   Wet & Cool : 1, 11, 12

By identifying this can help Singapore Government to develop strategies to deal with different situations, and also to see the trend in future if there is shift in different type of month
